# creating a go module 

go mod init golang_practice


if the code is split into multiple function but they are under the same package like main 
then they act as a single file
but run the code as "go run ." as it should consider all the files in the folder 


if we want to create multiple packages 
combine all the code to the package in single folder 
import the package in the import statment "packagename modulename/foldername"

to export the function all the functions first letter to be capital.
